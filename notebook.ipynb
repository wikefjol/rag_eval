      "Reference Answer: The proposal presents convincingly the researcher's record, which includes publications in high impact-factor journals, a demonstrated capacity to attract funding, experience in supervising and mentoring activities, prizes and awards. This record renders the researcher's professional growth during the fellowship highly credible. The researcher has already shown independence of thinking and very good potential to secure the proposal execution and to further reach professional maturity. The researcher's CV is very competitive, with high quality and impact publications, international mobility, and a multitude of relevant transferable skills. The professional experience and competences of the researcher are highly appropriate for the proposal. The institution has experience in hosting international researchers and the host group will be an excellent environment for the researcher. The expertise of the main supervisor, of the host research group, and of the supervisor at the secondment institution is soundly documented, and is a very good match with the research proposed. The planned non-academic placement is well described and its value for the project is very convincingly demonstrated, enabling the researcher to gain experience beyond academia and acquire new competences relevant to their profile, especially through the training of teachers.\n",
